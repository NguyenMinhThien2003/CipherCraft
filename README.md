# CipherCraft
This project is CipherCraft. You can utilize it by entering the message into the plaintext field and selecting your algorithms (Shift cipher, Affine cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, RailFence cipher), along with choosing your key. Finally, click the encrypt button to receive the ciphertext. Conversely, for decryption, follow the same process.
